Review of project:
I wanted to solve my own shopping pain point while shop online, but I get why online fashion store does not do this feature as it needs to manage complete database and every new item they add, categorised by proper fashion expert.



Perso requirement:
* The problem
* Demo (Heroku)
* Routes/Models/Schema
* Sore Bits - Spend too much time in CSS, where I would prefer to spend more time using Ruby and rails
* Cool Beans - Learn more about css which I don't understand previously.
* What's next?
